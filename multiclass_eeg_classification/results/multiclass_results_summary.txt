Multi-class EEG Classification Results
==================================================

Traditional ML:
  Hierarchical Ensemble: 0.565
  Confidence Ensemble: 0.900

Deep Learning:
  CNN-LSTM-Attention: 0.100

Baseline:
  Random: 0.100

Key Findings:
- Multi-class classification is significantly more challenging
- Best accuracy achieved: 0.900
- Confidence distributions are more realistic (lower)
- Hierarchical approaches show promise
