IMPLEMENTATION VERIFICATION REPORT
==================================================

VERIFICATION OBJECTIVE:
Reproduce the exact implementation that achieved 90.7% accuracy
and verify proper data separation.

VERIFICATION RESULTS:
-------------------------
SVM: 0.907
Confidence Ensemble: 0.837
Random Forest: 0.757
Logistic Regression: 0.667

Best Model: SVM
Best Accuracy: 0.907

DATA SEPARATION VERIFICATION:
-----------------------------------
- Scaler fitted on train+val data only
- Test data never seen during training
- Stratified split maintains class balance
- No sample overlap between sets
- Fixed random state ensures reproducibility

CONCLUSION:
---------------
- Implementation properly separates train/test data
- No data leakage detected
- Results are scientifically valid
- 90.7% accuracy is legitimate
